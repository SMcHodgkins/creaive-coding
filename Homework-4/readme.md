## Feedback
* Playlab- Have a way to end the level after you catch all the guys.
  * I tried doing this but couldn't get it working. Tried having a variable add up to 3 and then restart but couldn't add to the value.
* AppLab- It worked well on PC but you should of optimized it for phones.
  * Yeah every time I'd try and fix it for phones a different issue would crop up with layering of text and objects. Probably think about this prior to building something.

## Inspiration
I never thought I’d go to college when I was in school. From a young age I thought that higher education was for people smarter than me and I was ready to work a minimum wage job until I died. Seems like a dour outlook from an elementary age kid, but that was my reality. I graduated high school and worked for 6 years at random jobs. I always felt like I could be doing more, that I could be doing something better, but it wasn’t until I was in my last relationship where I decided that I’d try to going back to school. Even if going back to school was a complete failure, I’d still be happy that I tried. I wanted to be better for the person I was with and they cultivated my curiosity instead of stifling it like everyone else had. This inspired me to push forward into the unknown, do my best, and hope that things work out.
